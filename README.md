 This project is  for calculating new velocity, distance, and remaining fuel for a moving object based on given parameters such as velocity, acceleration, duration, initial distance, fuel amount, and fuel burn rate.

It defines given parameters like velocity, acceleration, duration, initial distance, fuel amount, and fuel burn rate.
There's a function calcNewVelocity which calculates new velocity based on acceleration, given velocity, and duration.
It validates input parameters and unit of measurements to ensure they are valid.
It converts units to a common unit (m/s, m, kg) for calculation consistency.
It calculates the new distance based on initial distance, velocity, and duration.
It calculates the remaining fuel based on fuel amount and fuel burn rate over the duration.
Finally, it calculates the new velocity based on acceleration.
It logs the corrected new velocity, new distance, and remaining fuel to the console.
